The material may be cut into smaller pieces before implantation, and may be shaped around a tissue (e.g. a bone) or inserted into a medical device that is then implanted. Implantation matrices are intended for release over an extended period of time, usually in order to obtain a local effect. Usually the matrix disappears with time. When the product is packaged as a separate matrix, powder and solvent (or matrix and solution), which are used to prepare the implantation matrix immediately before use, the appropriate combined term should be used; see for example ‘Powder, solvent and matrix for implantation matrix’.",
